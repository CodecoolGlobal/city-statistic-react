# City Statistic

#### About
In this project, we used [Teleport API](https://developers.teleport.org/api/) for our site to get pieces of information about cities. The visitor can check some information about the economy and 'how is life' in the city.

This is the front end side of our first spring boot application. During this project, we met with spring security and also with JWT token validation.
Also, this project consists of two parts, a backend side where we use Java enterprise, Spring boot & a frontend side where we used React. [Link to backend repository](https://github.com/CodecoolGlobal/city-statistic-spring)

Also for database, we used H2 where we stored information about users.

Team members were: Áron, Gabó, Péter, Tibi
